# Mobile App Design

## Quiet Study Spots
Find peaceful, quiet study spots around your area. Submitted from users.

### App Description:
Quiet Study Spots is a mobile app designed to help students or remote workers find a nice place to study. Whether this be for school, university, work from home or simply needing a quiet place to recharge.

The app will allow users to find and share locations of study spots. Users can use an inbuilt map that to find location tags that indicate study spots near them, with descriptions and categories attached to each spot for easy user experience. The user can also filter their searches to find spots with specific features, like a cafe, or power outlets. Each study location will also have an associated 'like' amount, where users can see how good a spot is based on the amount of likes it has.

### Main Features of Quiet Study Spots:
##### Login/Authenticaion:
The Quiet Study Spots app will have a login/signup page that will authenticate the users before allowing access to the rest of the app. This will be done through Firebase.

##### Home Page:
The home page of the app will be mainly taken up with the map. This map will use the users location and have location tags around their area for quiet spots to go study.
The 1/3 - 1/4 of the home page will have some button options. These options include: Add Location, Filter Search.

##### Data Storage:
This app will store a few different types of data. First is the User Login Data. Second is the Location Tags and third is the associated filter data attached to the location and the 'likes'.</br>
This data will be stored in a remote database throught the use of either MongoDB or Firebase.

##### Add Location Page:
This is the third screen for the app that will pop up when a user decided to add a study location that they like. It will take their current location and ask for them to add filters/categories to the location.


### Who are the users of Quiet Study Spots?
The main target audience for Quiet Study Spaces is students, mainly in university in the age range of 18-26, however there is also a smaller target audience that includes a larger age range for high school students and remote workers. 

##### User Groups:
1. Univeristy Students - Primary User Group:
    - 18-26 age range.
    - Need quiet spaces for focused study session including study, lectures and assignment work.
    - May need Wi-Fi, Power Outlets and Coffee/Food.
    - Often moving between places or studying between part-time work.
2. High School Students - Secondary User Group:
    - 14-18 age rane.
    - Need free after-school study spots, like libraries, to complete homework.
    - More likely to study collaboratively.
    - Need easy access as high scholl students are unlikely to have their own transport.
3. Remote Workers - Secondary User Group:
    - 24+ age range.
    - Need consistent workplaces with power outlets and Wi-Fi.
    - Preference for collaborative spaces / loud enviroments as they may have online meetings and need to talk.

##### Persona:

##### Why the target audience would choose Quiet Study Spaces over competitors.
The main competitor to Quiet Study Spaces would be a simple google search. Users would choose this app over something like that because it is a specialised app that has more features. A google search would give nearby study spots but it would not give the deapth that this app gives with it's options to filter locations based on preferences.


### Design - Wireframes and mockups

### What will be implemented into MVP and what will be left out?
A Favourites screen will be included but for this MVP, clicking on a favourite will not lead anywhere. It will be just a list. Futher, future functionality should include clicking on a favourite spot and opening it on the map.
